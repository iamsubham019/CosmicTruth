## Quickstart

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install torch-geometric
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. (Optional) Download FakeNewsNet dataset

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet.git
# Follow their instructions to download data
# Place in data/raw/fake/ and data/raw/real/
```

If no dataset is found, the system automatically generates a **synthetic dataset** so you can run and test the full pipeline immediately.

### 3. Train the model

```bash
python train.py
```

This will:
- Train the full tri-stream model for up to 20 epochs with early stopping
- Save the best checkpoint to `outputs/checkpoints/best_model.pt`
- Run a 5-configuration ablation study automatically
- Save all metrics to `outputs/logs/`

### 4. Evaluate + generate XAI reports

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

Generates:
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve
- Training curves
- Ablation bar chart
- Per-sample XAI reports (text attribution + GradCAM + modality weights)

### 5. Run the web demo

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## Model Architecture

Text (RoBERTa)  ──┐
                   ├──► Cross-Modal Attention Fusion ──► Classifier ──► Real/Fake + Explanation
Image (CLIP-ViT) ──┤
                   │
Social (GAT) ──────┘
                   │
                   └──► Text-Image Inconsistency Score  (Paper 2 signal)
```

### Key design decisions

**Why RoBERTa over BERT?**
RoBERTa uses dynamic masking during pretraining and removes the next-sentence prediction objective, consistently outperforming BERT on downstream classification tasks.

**Why CLIP-ViT over ResNet?**
CLIP's joint vision-language pretraining means image features are already semantically aligned with text — critical for cross-modal inconsistency detection.

**Why GAT over GCN?**
Graph Attention Networks learn to weight neighbor importance, which matters for propagation graphs where retweet source credibility varies.

**Why cross-modal attention instead of concatenation?**
Concatenation treats all modalities equally. Cross-modal attention lets the model learn WHICH modality to trust for each specific sample (a text-only fake news differs from an image-based one).

## XAI Methods

| Modality | Method | Library | Output |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Text | Gradient × Embedding | Captum / custom | Per-token importance score |
| Image | GradCAM | Captum | Spatial heatmap over image |
| Fusion | Cross-modal attention | PyTorch | Per-modality contribution weights |
| Text-Image | CLIP cosine similarity | HuggingFace | Inconsistency score 0–1 |

## Paper 1: Full System

**Title idea:** "TriXFND: Cross-Modal Attention Fusion with Tri-Stream Explainable Fake News Detection"

**Unique contributions:**
1. Three-stream architecture with text + image + social propagation
2. Cross-modal attention fusion (learned per-sample, not fixed concatenation)
3. Auxiliary text-image inconsistency loss during training
4. Quantitative XAI evaluation using AOPC (Area Over the Perturbation Curve)
5. Ablation study proving each modality contributes

**Target venues:** IEEE Access, Expert Systems with Applications, Information Processing & Management

## Paper 2: Inconsistency Detection

**Title idea:** "Out-of-Context Image Detection: CLIP-Based Cross-Modal Inconsistency Scoring for Fake News with XAI"

**Unique contribution:**
Fake news frequently uses *real images* with *false captions* (out-of-context manipulation). This module uses CLIP's joint embedding space to compute a semantic inconsistency score, visualizes which image patches are most contradictory to the text, and uses this as an interpretable signal.

**Run Paper 2 module:**
```python
from models.inconsistency_detector import CLIPInconsistencyDetector
from transformers import CLIPProcessor

detector = CLIPInconsistencyDetector()
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")

result = detector.explain_inconsistency(
    text="Flood victims rescued in Mumbai",
    image_tensor=your_image_tensor,
    processor=processor,
)
print(result["verdict"])
print(f"Inconsistency: {result['inconsistency_score']:.4f}")
```
